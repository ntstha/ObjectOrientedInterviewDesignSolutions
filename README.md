I also some popular OOP questions here


First problem 

Write code that will be used by a Shopping cart service to enforce rules on the order

eg. 
Offer free 2 day shipping on orders > $35 if customer is not a prime member 
Offer free 2 day shipping on all orders if customer is a prime member 
Offer free 1 day shipping for order that are > $125 
Offer free 2 hour shipping for prime customer that have > $25 and the items are grocery items

Make this extensible to add other rules in the future Apply a 10% discount if an item has been marked for subscribe and save
